## Data visualisation 

![](tidyverse_website.png)

We'll be revisiting the todyverse for visualisation. In particular, the most popular package for plotting is `ggplot2`. In order to get the data into the shape that `ggplot2` likes (i.e. the long format), we'll be using the `tidyr` package

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# read in last lesson's data
autism.data <- read.csv(file = "autism_data.csv",
                        header = TRUE,
                        sep = ",",
                        na.strings = "?")

# rename the column with the typo
colnames(autism.data)[17] <- "country"

# make a new column of patient IDs called pids
new_ids <- paste( "PatientID_" , autism.data$id, sep = "")
autism.data$pids <- new_ids 

# remove the patient who was 383 years old
autism.data <- autism.data[-which.max(autism.data$age), ]
```

There are two main functions in `tidyr`. These are `gather()` and `spread()`, and they allow for the conversion between long and wide data formats. 

Wide format are more natural for human reading. This is where we have samples in rows and variables in columns. In contrast, the long format is key-value pairing for each sample and variable. This might be clearer with some examples.

## gather()
The `gather()` function transform your data from wide to long format. To do so, we need to provide `gather()` with the name of the new column where all the variable names will be presented with the `key` argument, the name of the new column where the values will be stored with teh `value` argument and the names of any columns you want to include (or exclude) in the gathering process.

```{r}
autism.data %>% 
  select(A1_Score, A2_Score, A3_Score, A4_Score, A5_Score, A6_Score, A7_Score, A8_Score, A9_Score, A10_Score) %>%
  gather(key = "AQ", value = "score") %>%
  head()
```

We can exclude certain variables from the gathering process. For example if we didn't want to gather the PatientID and also the Class/ASD variables, we can note these in the `gather()` function
```{r}
autism.data %>% 
  select(pids, Class.ASD, A1_Score, A2_Score, A3_Score, A4_Score, A5_Score, A6_Score, A7_Score, A8_Score, A9_Score, A10_Score) %>%
  gather(key = "AQ", value = "score", -pids, -Class.ASD) %>%
  head()
```


## spread()
The `spread()` function transforms from long to wide format. 
```{r}
autism.data %>% 
  select(pids, Class.ASD, A1_Score, A2_Score, A3_Score, A4_Score, A5_Score, A6_Score, A7_Score, A8_Score, A9_Score, A10_Score) %>%
  gather(key = "AQ", value = "score", -pids, -Class.ASD) -> longdata


longdata %>% 
  spread(AQ, score) %>%
  head()
```
